Hi there!  
I'm Niklas, currently a Research Scientist @[Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com), where I work on memory in language models, reasoning with structured data, cryptography and different types of interpretability.  
Previously I was an AI and Fundamental Physics Research Associate @[MIT](https://mit.edu), where I worked on interpretability and robustness, both researching in the AI space aswell as using gained insights for more trustable data collection in collider physics.  
In 2021 I completed a PhD in Physics from [CERN](https://home.cern/),
where I developed trigger & core software for the upgrade of the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/).  
Python and C++ are the languages I do best.  

See my [CV]({{site.url}}/files/cv_13.pdf) for more details.

When not at work, you might find me playing video games, in the gym, outside, playing lasertag, skiing, biking or so.

### Papers
*Last update: Jan 8, 2025*

While at CERN and MIT, I was part of a large experimental physics collaboration, LHCb, which jointly publishes everything. I did not have direct contributions to the papers individually, but I was part of the team that developed the software and algorithms to be able to collect the data in the first place. This makes my [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5elJ_uIAAAAJ&hl=de) page a little wonky, therefore I keep track here, where I contributed directly to the papers.
