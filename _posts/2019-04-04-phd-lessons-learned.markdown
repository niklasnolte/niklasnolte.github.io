### A successful PhD
Now that I am 1.5 years into the PhD (roughly half time), there has already
passed quite some time to look back at. 1.5 years is quite some time to
produce some cool things, right?  

Yeah, no. At least I didn't. Looking back,
one could have achieved the same results in MUCH less time.  That's probably
normal, I suppose(?). One should not be particularly frustrated about this
fact, though.  

Never forget that a PhD is education (otherwise people would pay
you better ^^), so it's all about learning.  IMHO, a PhD is a success if the
candidate learns a lot of useful stuff, builds up a high frustration barrier
and develops a feeling for how to proceed towards the bigger goal from the
scientists perspective.

### Writing down stuff
A PhD programme in a technical/nature sciencey field like physics typically comprises
 - a lot of annoying technical problems
 - much research work (if you are lucky)
 - not so much writing down stuff (if you are lucky)

When starting to actually write down whatever one did into a thesis, one
probably will have forgotten  what has been done in the last N years. One could
of course counter this by writing parts of the thesis whenever a project is
finished. But let's be honest, who could possibly muster this kind of
discipline?  

What I have found to be quite helpful is to make some mediocrely
detailed notes at the end of the day or week, in a journal or diary if you
wish. It takes some time to get used to it, but I found
[monkkee.com](https://monkkee.com) to be quite a good site to store my notes.

Looking back now on roughly ~100 entries at least gives me the feeling that i
wasn't idling around all this time. And it's also a great way to find stuff
that you did some time ago, i regularly search within those notes!
