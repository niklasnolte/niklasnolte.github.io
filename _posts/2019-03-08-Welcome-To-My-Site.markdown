Hi there, nice to meet you!  
I'm Niklas, a Fundamental Physics and AI Research Associate @[MIT](https://mit.edu).  
I just freshly graduated with a PhD in Physics from [CERN](https://home.cern/),  
where I developed trigger & core software for the upgrade of the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/) in 2022.  
While I still do this every once in a while now, I shifted my focus to AI research for fundamental physics, specifically robustness.
C++ and python are the languages I do and like best.  
I also enjoy wasting time reconfiguring my distro to maximize my efficiency (haha).  
When not at work, you might find me playing my beloved video games,  
or outside playing lasertag, skiing, biking or so.
