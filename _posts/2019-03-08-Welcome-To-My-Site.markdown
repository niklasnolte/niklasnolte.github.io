Hi there, let me introduce myself.  
I am a physics PhD candidate @[CERN](https://home.cern/),  
where I develop trigger & core software for the upgrade of the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/) in 2021.  
C++ and python are the languages I do and like best.  
I also enjoy wasting time reconfiguring my distro to maximize my efficiency (haha).  
When not at work, you might find me playing my beloved video games,  
or outside playing lasertag, skiing, biking or so.
